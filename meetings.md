# Meeting Minutes
## FL Meeting:  Thurs, Sep 11, 4:30 pm

### Action Items 
- [ ] Look into Compute Canada, and how I can access these resources
- [ ] Set up FL development environment on my machine (Flower AI/ Flare)
- [ ] Deploy an FL model locally on my machine
- [ ] Clone `xTP-LLM` repository
### Other Notes & Information
- Dr. Sehra has a fine tuned `xTP-LLM` model.
- Main problem with `xTP-LLM` is that it is very computationally expensive (around 25 GBs of GPU memory) 
 - Try to implement 1 or 2 papers (clone repo, run model locally). Find gaps, and bring novelty.
