# Meeting Minutes
## Thurs, Sep 11
- [x] Look into Compute Canada, and how I can access these resources
- [x] Set up FL development environment on my machine (Flower AI/ Flare)
- [x] Clone `xTP-LLM` repository

### Other Notes & Information
- Dr. Sehra has a fine tuned `xTP-LLM` model.
- Main problem with `xTP-LLM` is that it is very computationally expensive (around 25 GBs of GPU memory) 
 - Try to implement 1 or 2 papers (clone repo, run model locally). Find gaps, and bring novelty. 

## Friday, Sep 19
- ~[ ] Clone Flower ai LLM example from github~ 
- ~[ ] Run FL LLM simulation on flower~
    -Need GPU to run flowertune-llm example
### Other Notes and Information:
- Google summer of code

## Tuesday, Sep 23 
- [x] Register for compute canadas resources 

## Friday Sep 26
- [x] Access compute canadas resources from my machine (setup ssh key and request access)
- [X] Run flowertune-llm example and simulate FL setting (3 clients) on HPC resources
- [ ] Run xTP-llm fine tuning script on compute resources

## Tuesday Sep 30
- [ ] Create flow chart/gant chart to track project progress
